# How I AI: How Custom GPTs Can Make You a Better Manager with Hilary Gridley

We talk a lot about how AI transforms the work of the individual contributor. We see the coding agents, the writing assistants, and the design tools.

But we don't talk enough about what AI means for the manager.

Being a manager is often about articulation. It is about taking the taste and intuition you have built up over years and explaining it to someone else so they can execute.

That is surprisingly hard to do.

[FRAME_0]

In this episode of How I AI, I sat down with Hilary Gridley, Head of Core Product at Whoop. Hillary has built—by her own estimation—dozens of custom GPTs explicitly designed to scale her management style.

She isn't using AI to replace her leadership. She is using it to clone her criteria for excellence.

Here is how she reverse-engineers her own taste to build better teams.

## The "Make It Pop" Problem

We have all had that manager. The one who looks at a design or a deck and says, "Make it look more like a thing." They know what they want, but they can't articulate it.

They have taste, but they lack a rubric.

Hillary’s approach to solving this is fascinating. She treats her management style like a recommendation algorithm that needs training.

She starts by collecting examples of "Good" and "Bad" work. She literally keeps a folder of "Before" slides (the messy ones) and "After" slides (the ones she edited).

This is where the magic happens.

She uploads these examples into a PDF with two columns: Left side: Bad; Right side: Good. Then, she asks the AI a simple question:

*"I have edited everything. Can you help me articulate the criteria I am using to determine what is good and bad based on these examples?"*

Instead of trying to write a perfect prompt from scratch, she lets the AI analyze her behavior to find the pattern. It is comically low-tech, but it works perfectly.

## Building "The Deck Doctor"

Once the AI identifies the criteria—things like "visual hierarchy" or "clarity over jargon"—Hillary doesn't stop there.

She uses those criteria to build a custom GPT. She calls one of them "The Deck Doctor."

[FRAME_1]

She asks the GPT to write a system prompt for *itself* based on her criteria. She gives it a specific job:

*"Your job is to evaluate slide decks for people on my team using my specific criteria. Start with a 1-5 rating on each criterion before diving into specific examples."*

Now, when her team needs feedback, they don't have to wait for a synchronous meeting with her.

They can upload their PDF to The Deck Doctor. The GPT gives them immediate, specific feedback based on Hillary’s actual standards.

It takes the work from 0% to 70% without Hillary needing to be in the room. That is massive leverage.

## Prompting for Specificity

One of my favorite takeaways from this conversation was Hillary’s obsession with specificity. 

We often tell AI to be "more creative" or "better." That is too vague.

Hillary uses a prompt I am absolutely stealing: **"Be 100 times more specific."**

Quantifying the request forces the model to dig deeper. If she wants it to be more creative, she might say, "Be 20% more creative." 

It sounds funny, but treating these qualitative adjustments like quantitative dials gives you much finer control over the output.

## Getting Invited to the "Cool Meetings"

Hillary also uses AI to help her team think strategically. She tells her reports that the way to get into high-level strategic meetings isn't to ask for an invite—it is to get pulled in.

You get pulled in by having a compelling point of view.

[FRAME_2]

When writing a strategic memo or a newsletter, Hillary doesn't ask AI, "Is this good?" (The model is usually too nice).

Instead, she asks: *"Can you succinctly express my thesis back to me?"*

If the AI can't repeat her main point clearly, she knows her writing isn't sharp enough yet. She also asks for "blind spots" in her argument.

It is about using the AI to stress-test your thinking, not just to fix your grammar.

## The "Mean Girls" Technique

Finally, we have to talk about how Hillary handles stubborn AI models.

When a model like ChatGPT isn't giving her what she wants, she goes to Claude.

She will paste the output into Claude and say, "Look at what this model did. It's terrible. How do we fix this?"

She calls it social engineering for robots. She pits the models against each other to get the best result. It is hilarious, but it is also a legitimate strategy for getting unstuck.

## Scale Your Impact

The goal of these tools isn't to automate your job away. It is to automate the repetitive parts of management—the initial feedback loops, the basic criteria checks—so you can spend your time on high-leverage coaching.

Build your own Deck Doctor. Your calendar will thank you.
