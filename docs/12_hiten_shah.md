# How I AI: Mastering ChatGPT: Advanced Techniques for Workplace Success with Hiten Shah

If you don’t love frameworks, you need to start loving frameworks.

That is the philosophy of Hiten Shah, a B2B SaaS legend who has been building companies for over 20 years.

But Hiten isn’t just a founder. By my estimation, he is a total ChatGPT power user.

We aren't talking about writing simple emails. Hiten is clocking in three to six hours a day with AI.

He has figured out how to load ChatGPT Projects with deep context about himself, his boss, and his sales frameworks, fundamentally changing how he works.

Here is how Hiten Shah masters context to build better with AI.

[FRAME_0]

## The Art of Context Management

Hiten is explicitly thoughtful about what he tells ChatGPT and, more importantly, what he lets it remember.

His first tip? Be intentional with memories.

If he is talking about something random that he doesn't want polluting his long-term context, he uses a **temporary session**.

He also frequently archives chats because they don't count toward the active memory bank.

It sounds tedious, but for Hiten, context is everything. If the input is messy, the output is useless.

He even has a project dedicated solely to making other projects, ensuring his instructions are always structured correctly.

## “What Would Morgan Do?”

This is one of the best use cases for ICs (Individual Contributors) I have seen.

Hiten reports to Morgan, his VP of Product. Morgan has an “Operating Manual”—a document explaining how he likes to work.

Instead of just reading it, Hiten built a ChatGPT Project called **WWMD (What Would Morgan Do)**.

Here is his workflow:

1.  **Create a Project.** Name it WWMD.
2.  **Upload the Context.** He uploads Morgan’s operating manual and articles Morgan has shared (like “The Job is Communication”).
3.  **Set the Instructions.** He tells ChatGPT: “I want to be able to converse with this project and simulate the type of feedback my boss would give me.”

Now, before Hiten pitches a crazy product idea, he runs it through the simulator.

He asks: “I want to pitch Morgan the craziest product idea I can think of. What is the best way to pitch it so we can go after it?”

The output isn’t generic advice. It is tailored specifically to what Morgan respects, quoting his own manual back to Hiten.

It’s like having a cheat code for managing up.

## The Personal Operating System

Hiten doesn’t just model his boss; he models himself.

He calls this his **Personal OS**.

He feeds a Project with his own personality data:

*   Enneagram Type (He’s a Type 9)
*   Myers-Briggs
*   Human Design (Yes, even the “woo woo” stuff)
*   His voice and tone guide

By combining his Personal OS with his Boss’s OS, he can ask highly specific questions about interpersonal dynamics.

For example: “My boss is an Enneagram 5, and I am a 9. How should I approach this conflict?”

We tested this live on the show. Hiten ran “Deep Research” on me, found out I’m an Enneagram 1 and a Sagittarius, and asked ChatGPT how to tell me “No” on a roadmap item.

The advice? “Frame it as a structured experiment.”

It was startlingly accurate. It’s psychological warfare, empowered by OpenAI.

## Scaling Sales Frameworks

Hiten loves frameworks because they are proven strategies. One of his favorites is the **Winning by Design** sales methodology.

Instead of memorizing PDFs, he uploaded the entire framework into a ChatGPT Project.

[FRAME_2]

Now, when he needs a discovery call script, he doesn’t start from scratch.

He asks the Project to generate a script based on the SPICE framework (Situation, Pain, Impact, Critical Event, Decision).

If the AI lacks context on the specific product, Hiten runs a **Deep Research** prompt on the target company or product first.

He then pastes that research into the Sales Project and asks it to refine the script.

This turns a generic sales template into a hyper-relevant, persona-driven discovery guide in seconds.

## Don't Automate Too Early

Hiten’s final piece of advice is counterintuitive for a tech founder.

**Do not rush to automation.**

Too many people try to build complex automated workflows before they understand the inputs.

Hiten prefers the “blank canvas.” He spends time manually refining prompts and interacting with the chat.

Only once he can get the model to reliably produce greatness manually does he think about automating it.

Improve your input, and the output will follow.
