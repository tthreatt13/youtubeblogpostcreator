# How I AI: How to make your writing better using AI with Farhad Manjoo

There is a pervasive fear among creatives that AI-generated writing is sloppy, generic, or destined to replace human creativity entirely.

But for Farhad Manjoo, former New York Times columnist and a leading voice in tech writing, AI isn't a replacement.

It’s a specialized companion.

Farhad has moved past the initial skepticism of early LLMs to develop a workflow where ChatGPT acts as a research assistant, a "super-thesaurus," and a first-pass editor.

In this episode of How I AI, we dig into the specific prompts and workflows he uses to make his writing more specific, impactful, and efficient.

## From Skeptic to Dual-Screen Writer

When ChatGPT launched in 2023, the writing quality wasn't there yet. It felt robotic. But as the models improved, the utility shifted from "writing generator" to "always-on assistant."

Now, Farhad writes with two windows open side by side: his document and ChatGPT.

It’s not about letting the AI write the column. It’s about offloading the cognitive load of retrieving information so he can focus on the craft of the sentences themselves.

## The Ultimate Research Assistant

Before AI, brainstorming a complex topic required a "Google loop" that could take half a day.

You have to find the articles, read them, synthesize the consensus, and then find your angle.

With ChatGPT’s web search capabilities (specifically model 4.5), this process can be completed in minutes.

For example, if you are writing about a contentious political topic like tariffs, you can ask:

*"Tell me about the commentary on tariffs, specifically any arguments saying they are good."*

Instead of hunting for links, the AI provides a summary of the landscape, identifies key figures, and provides citations.

Since the introduction of web search citations, the "hallucination" risk has dropped significantly because you can click through to verify sources immediately.

It lets you interrogate the news landscape like you would a research assistant, asking follow-up questions to uncover angles others might be missing.

## The "Super Thesaurus" Technique

This is perhaps the most high-value workflow for anyone who cares about words.

Traditional thesauruses are limited. They give you direct synonyms, but they lack context, idiom, and metaphor.

Farhad uses ChatGPT to hunt for the *perfect* phrase.

In a recent piece, he needed an idiom that conveyed the idea of consequences catching up to someone. The phrase "pay the piper" felt cliché.

By pasting the sentence into ChatGPT and asking for metaphorically similar idioms, he moved past the basics (like "foot the bill") to more evocative imagery, like "the chickens came home to roost" or "the devil came to collect."

You can even debate the imagery with the AI.

If it suggests "the storm he'd been whistling past finally broke," you can push back on the mixed metaphor, and it will iterate with you until the sentence sings.

It turns the solitary act of word selection into a collaborative jam session.

## The AI as a First Reader

Writers often get stuck worrying if an argument is landing before the piece is finished.

Farhad uses AI as a "temperature check" after writing the first six or seven paragraphs.

He pastes the draft in and asks specific structural questions:

*   *"Does this get my point across quickly enough?"*
*   *"Is there a way to get to the argument faster?"*
*   *"Am I doing too much unnecessary commentary?"*

It’s not going to find deep logical fallacies, but it is excellent at identifying pacing issues and fluff.

This allows him to polish the structure in real time rather than waiting for a human editor to review a finished draft.

## The Verdict

Using AI this way doesn't make the writing feel robotic; it actually frees you up to be *more* specific.

By speeding up the research and word-finding process, you spend less time searching and more time crafting.

It’s the end of the blank page staring contest.
