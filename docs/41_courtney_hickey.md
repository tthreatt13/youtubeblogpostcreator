# How I AI: How Zapier's EA Automates Executive Ops with Courtney Hickey

I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Executive Assistants is that AI will replace them.

After talking to Courtney Hickey, EA to the CEO at Zapier, I’m convinced of the opposite.

AI isn't replacing the EA. It’s turning them into an entire operations department.

Courtney isn’t just managing calendars. She is building "armies of interns" using Zapier Agents, custom GPTs, and NotebookLM to scale herself and her executive.

She is automating meeting prep, democratizing strategy, and even creating an AI version of her CEO to stress-test ideas.

This episode is one of the most practical, time-saving deep dives we have ever had.

Here is how Courtney is using AI to build a "second brain" for executive operations.

## The "Friday Prep" Agent

We all know the pain of Friday afternoon.

You have two hours blocked off to figure out what is happening next week. You are digging through CRM data, Slack threads, and old emails to get context on who you are meeting.

Courtney automated that entire process.

She built a workflow using **Zapier Agents** that triggers every Friday at 8:00 AM. It acts as a dedicated research intern.

Here is exactly what the agent does:

1.  **Scans the Calendar:** It identifies all external meetings for the upcoming week.
2.  **Research:** It searches the web for participant roles and industry news.
3.  **CRM Lookup:** It checks HubSpot to see if there are active deals or recent sales notes.
4.  **Internal Context:** It searches Gmail and Slack history to find previous interactions with that company.

The output is brilliant.

It creates a task in her Todoist with all the context she needs, scheduled exactly two hours before the meeting starts.

Simultaneously, it sends a structured digest to Slack. This digest includes a summary of the week ahead, error handling (if it couldn't find someone), and—crucially—**AI-generated insights**.

The agent might say, "Hey, this is a new vendor relationship, make sure to check with the head of marketing for PR priorities first."

It’s not just data entry; it’s reasoning.

## Automating Culture and Feedback

Most organizations struggle to reinforce their cultural values. You have these great values on a wall somewhere, but are they showing up in your Tuesday morning standup?

Courtney uses AI to audit meetings against Zapier’s operating principles.

She was initially doing this manually with Fathom, but now she has automated it across the org using tools like Fellow.

[FRAME_1]

After a meeting, the AI analyzes the transcript not just for action items, but for behavior. It looks for things like:

*   Did we balance being "demanding and supportive"?
*   Did we address conflict directly?
*   Was the decision-making speed appropriate?

It then sends a direct message to participants with specific coaching. For example: "You seemed to have a fear of conflict on this topic. Next time, address the misalignment directly."

Because the feedback comes from a bot, it takes the "spit off the ball." It’s less personal and emotional than a boss's critique, which makes people more open to the feedback.

## The "Will This Fly With the CEO?" GPT

One of the biggest bottlenecks in any company is waiting for executive review. Everyone wants to know, "What would Wade (the CEO) think of this strategy doc?"

Courtney realized she was fielding too many "quick looks" for thought partnership. So, she built a custom GPT to replicate the CEO's feedback style.

She fed the GPT:
*   Company values.
*   Revenue roadmaps.
*   Strategy memos.
*   Examples of good "Tea-up" documents.
*   Examples of Wade’s actual feedback.

Now, anyone at Zapier can feed a draft strategy doc into this GPT before the meeting.

The GPT will roast the document. It will say things like, "This reads more like a jam session than a decision doc. Tighten up the trade-offs."

It saves the CEO time, it saves Courtney time, and it ensures that when a meeting actually happens, the materials are high-quality.

## The Strategy Companion

Finally, Courtney tackled a problem every growing SaaS company has: Information silos.

Strategic documents usually die in Google Drive folders. Nobody reads them, and nobody remembers how they connect.

Courtney used **NotebookLM** to create a "Strategy Companion."

[FRAME_2]

She uploaded dozens of sources, including top-level strategy documents, all-hands transcripts, and department action plans.

Now, employees can query the strategy. They can ask, "I'm an EA. How does my role map to the 2026 strategy?"

The tool gives specific, cited answers. It even generates an audio podcast summarizing the strategy for people who learn better by listening.

It transforms static documents into an interactive knowledge base.

## The Future of the EA Role

There is a fear that AI will make the EA role obsolete. Courtney proves that is nonsense.

When you automate the calendar Tetris and data retrieval, you open up space for higher-leverage work.

You move from being an admin to being a Chief of Staff or an Operations Leader. You become the person who builds the systems that make everyone else faster.

It is not about whether you adopt these tools. It is about when.
