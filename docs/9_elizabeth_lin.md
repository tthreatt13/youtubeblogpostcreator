# How I AI: A Designer's Guide to Cursor with Elizabeth Lin

Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire Vo, and today we are breaking the mold on who "should" be using coding tools.

We are talking to Elizabeth Lin, a product designer and Cursor power user. But here is the kicker: she isn't using Cursor just to write code.

She is using it to design better, prototype faster, and explore aesthetics that would take hours to build by hand.

From generating Y2K-inspired websites to building fully functional pianos with sound, Elizabeth shows us how to teach an LLM to have good taste.

Let's get to it.

## Asking AI for the Vibe

Most of us start a project with a specific look in mind. Elizabeth flips that script.

Instead of forcing a style, she asks Cursor what it is actually good at. She opens a blank project and asks:

*"What design aesthetics and movements are you comfortable implementing? List the styles and describe them to me."*

This is brilliant because it lets the LLM tell you where its strengths lie.

In our demo, Cursor suggested everything from Cyberpunk to Vaporwave. It even broke down the specific elements of those styles, like neon color schemes or glitch effects.

We decided to test it out. We asked Cursor to redesign a boring homepage in two distinct styles: **Brutalist** and **Y2K**.

The result? A chaotic, nostalgic, fully functional page complete with typing animations and excessive glow effects. 

It wasn't just a static image; it was code I could interact with immediately.

## Prototyping Interactivity (That Figma Can't Do)

Designers love Figma, but it has limits. Specifically, it is really hard to prototype sound or complex logic.

Elizabeth showed me how she uses Cursor to build "toys" that work instantly. 

With a single prompt, she asked for a digital piano in the style of old Mac OS.

Because she has a coding background, she set up a "Cursor Rule" beforehand. This rule tells Cursor that whenever she asks for a prototype, it should automatically create a new folder and link it to her homepage.

Within seconds, we had a working piano. You could click the keys, hear the sound, and even change the waveforms.

For a designer, this is a superpower. You aren't just showing a picture of an app; you are handing someone a working version of it to play with.

## How to Fix Ugly AI Design

We have all been there. You ask an LLM for a dashboard, and it gives you something... hideous. 

Chaotic colors. Drop shadows everywhere—terrible spacing.

Elizabeth walked me through her process for turning a "yuck" dashboard into something professional.

Her strategy involves specific, targeted prompting:

1.  **The specific fix:** "Remove all drop shadows."
2.  **The reference check:** "Make it look like Robinhood, Cash App, or Stripe."
3.  **The psychological hack:** "Can you improve the layout to make it look like something a top designer at Apple would approve of?"

That last prompt is a game-changer. 

By invoking a high standard (like Apple), the model instantly tightened up the grid, fixed the alignment, and applied a much cleaner aesthetic.

## Data-Driven Prototyping

Finally, Elizabeth showed us the holy grail of prototyping: using real data.

She built a personal book-tracking app—essentially her own version of Goodreads—powered entirely by a Notion database.

Cursor handled the integration, allowing her to pull in her actual reading list and display it in a custom UI.

This bridges the gap between a "Dribbble shot" and a real product. You aren't just designing a card; you are designing how the system handles your actual information.

## Teaching AI to Have Taste

My biggest takeaway from Elizabeth? You have to broaden your inputs.

If you want creative outputs, don't just ask for "a modern website." Feed the AI weird inputs. Send it a K-pop music video. Show it a piece of classical art.

Treat the LLM like a junior designer who needs inspiration, and you will be surprised at how creative it can get.
