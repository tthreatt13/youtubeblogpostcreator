# How I AI: Getting Product and Design Teams to Adopt AI with Brian Greenbaum

Does your organization have "Secret AI" syndrome?

You know what I mean. 

It’s when your team is quietly using their personal ChatGPT accounts to do work because they aren't sure what's allowed. Or worse, hoarding their new skills because they want to be the only "AI wizard" in the room.

Brian Greenbaum, Senior Staff Product Designer at Pendo, joined me on the show to share his exact playbook for breaking through that barrier.

Brian didn’t wait for permission. He used his paternity leave to become an AI power user, sent a bold message to his CPO, and came back to lead a massive AI transformation at Pendo.

Here is how he turned a personal epiphany into a company-wide movement.

## The Paternity Leave Epiphany

It started in a nursery.

While rocking his newborn, Brian decided to try Cursor for the first time. He had a side project idea: a music player that scanned QR codes on laminated cards to play albums (because New York apartments don't have space for record players).

He isn't a developer. He couldn't write the app from scratch.

But within a couple of hours using Cursor, he had a working prototype generating PDFs and QR codes.

It blew him away.

He realized immediately that this wasn't just for hobby apps. This was the future of prototyping for product designers.

Instead of static Figma mockups, designers could build code-based prototypes with real data interactions.

So, while still on leave, he sent a message to his manager, the CPO, and other leaders.

His pitch was simple: **We need to uplevel the skills of our entire product organization.**

He raised his hand to lead it. And that is the first lesson here: AI is a unique leadership opportunity.

If you are the first to raise your hand and say, "I'm going to figure out how our team uses this," you position yourself as a change agent.

## The Two-Pronged Approach: Sync and Async

Getting a team to adopt AI requires more than just enthusiasm.

Brian implemented a two-part strategy to drive culture change:

### 1. The "Product AI" Sessions (Synchronous)

Brian set up bi-weekly sessions. But these weren't lectures.

He knew that if people didn't get their hands dirty, they wouldn't learn. 

In one session, he had everyone go to **bolt.new** and type in the same prompt to build a To-Do list app. 

Then, he told them to get weird.

"Make it look like MySpace 2007."
"Add a retro 8-bit theme."

Everyone got different results. They saw the models' diversity in real time. 

It broke the ice and showed them that AI can be fun, not just a productivity hack.

### 2. Radical Many-to-Many Sharing (Asynchronous)

He created a Slack channel specifically for sharing AI wins and failures.

This combats the "information hoarding" I see in so many companies.

You want a culture where people post their experiments publicly. 

It creates a flywheel effect where one person's discovery becomes the whole team's new superpower.

## The Golden Path: Killing Shadow IT

One of the biggest blockers to AI adoption is fear.

Employees don't know which tools are legal, which data is safe, or whether they'll get fired for using a chatbot.

Brian solved this by working with Security, Legal, and Finance to define the **Golden Path**.

He created a centralized "AI Knowledge Center" in Confluence.

It’s a simple table, but it is critical. It lists:

*   **The Tool:** (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney)
*   **The Status:** (Approved, Pilot, Blocked)
*   **Data Policy:** (Public data only, Internal data allowed, PII allowed)
*   **Access:** (How to request a license)

If you do not have this document in your org, stop reading and go make it.

You cannot accelerate if your team is afraid to step on the gas.

## Moving Beyond MVP to "Magic"

One of my favorite takeaways from Brian is how AI helps us escape the tyranny of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

As product people, we've been beaten down by scope creep. We stop asking for the "magic" features because we know engineering doesn't have the budget.

With AI, that changes.

Brian’s team used Midjourney to create animated characters for an intro screen—something that would have been cut immediately in the old world.

AI lets designers return to the craft of building **awesome** products, not just **viable** ones.

## Proving Value with MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Brian didn't stop at design. He dove into the deep end of technical AI by building an MCP server for Pendo.

(If you think MCP sounds like sorcery, you aren't alone. I did too until I built one.)

Basically, he built a way for an LLM to talk directly to Pendo's data APIs.

He could ask Claude: "Show me a dashboard of the top used features for the last 30 days."

And it would actually build the visualization.

He demoed this to the CTO, and it immediately impacted the roadmap. 

He proved the value not by arguing for it, but by **building** it.

That is the era we are in. The builders are winning. The ones who can touch the technology and show what it can do are the ones who will lead.
