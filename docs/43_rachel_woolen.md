# How I AI: How Webflow's CPO Built an AI Chief of Staff to Manage Her Time with Rachel Woolen

We often talk about the AI-native Product Manager or the AI-native Engineer. 

But what about the AI-native Executive?

I’m a “just-in-time” executive. That means the two seconds before I walk into a meeting is usually the only time I have to prep. 

[FRAME_0]

Rachel Woolen, CPO at Webflow, operates the same way. But she didn't just accept the chaos of back-to-back context switching. 

She built herself an AI Chief of Staff to fix it.

Rachel joined me on *How I AI* to show off the custom “vibe coded” tools she uses to manage her calendar, prep for networking dinners, and tell her the brutal truth about her schedule.

She also broke down exactly how she drives AI adoption across her entire product org through “Builder Days.”

Here’s how she does it.

## The “Brutal Truth” of the AI Chief of Staff

Rachel started vibe coding about a year ago. She realized that while she had a fancy C-level title, she was still bogged down by repetitive tasks that didn't require her unique human insight.

She built a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that acts as her personal Chief of Staff. It hooks directly into her Google Calendar and Gmail via API tokens.

Every morning, she runs a specific workflow: “Tell me about my day.”

The AI analyzes her schedule, identifies meetings that could be handled by email, and suggests delegations. 

But my favorite feature? The “Brutal Truth” mode.

She programmed the agent to be mean to her. 

In the demo, the AI bluntly told her: *“You're operating as a Senior PM, not a CPO. You're reviewing PRDs and approving scripts. Fatal flaw.”*

It’s the kind of feedback a human Chief of Staff might hesitate to give, but an AI delivers without ego. It forces her to elevate her operating level instantly.

## The “Farm-to-Table” App Approach

What I love about Rachel’s approach is that she isn't waiting for a SaaS product to solve her niche problems. She is building “artisanal, farm-to-table” software for an N of 1 (herself).

Take her dinner prep workflow.

As an introvert, prepping for networking events drains energy. Rachel built a workflow where she simply drops a screenshot of a guest list into her tool.

The AI OCRs the names, searches LinkedIn and the web for recent news on the guests, and cross-references it with a repository of markdown files containing Rachel’s own context and company updates.

The result? A briefing doc with personalized conversation starters and context, generated in seconds.

**The takeaway:** You don’t need a complex database. Storing your personal context in simple markdown files allows your agents to reference your "brain" easily.

## Driving Adoption with Builder Days

Rachel isn't just hoarding these superpowers. She’s actively pushing her team at Webflow to become AI-native.

She runs “Builder Days”—a dedicated time where the entire organization stops its everyday work to build a prototype.

The rules are simple:

1.  Pick a tool (Cursor, Figma, Make, Webflow).
2.  Build something real (not just a theory).
3.  Present it.

The results from their last session were staggering. They had over 80 prototypes built in a single day across design, product, and engineering.

More importantly, it “bluepilled” the team. 

People who were skeptical or intimidated by coding realized they could go from idea to execution in hours, not weeks. 

## The Era of the Hard Skill

If there is one lesson from Rachel’s workflow, it’s this: There is no substitute for getting hands-on.

You don’t need to be a 10x engineer. But you do need to understand how to glue these tools together.

Whether it’s a simple script to audit your calendar or a markdown-powered research bot, the ability to build your own software is the new executive superpower.
