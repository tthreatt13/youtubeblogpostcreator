# How I AI: How to Create Your Own AI Performance Coach with Lucas Werthein

Lucas Werthein is the Head of Technology at Cactus, where he has built products for brands like Apple, Coca-Cola, and Beyoncé.

But today, we aren’t talking about enterprise product development.

We are talking about how Lucas built a custom "Well Coached" GPT to optimize his nutrition, manage injuries, and keep himself performing like a 25-year-old (despite being 40).

Lucas is an athlete. He surfs, plays tennis, and lifts weights naturally, which can lead to injuries.

Like many of us, he had plenty of data—blood panels, nutrition plans, Whoop scores, and MRI imaging—but no way to synthesize it.

Here is how he used ChatGPT to build a unified health strategist that connects the dots between his doctors, his data, and his daily life.

## The Problem: Data Silos

Most people have health data, but it is scattered.

Your doctor has your bloodwork. Your physical therapist is aware of your knee history. Your wearable knows you slept poorly last night.

Lucas realized that professionals are great at their specific niche, but they lack the full context of his daily reality.

He wanted an AI that could sit in the middle of all these experts.

## Building the Knowledge Base

This is where Lucas went further than most users.

He didn't just paste in text. He used ChatGPT's multimodal capabilities to ingest complex medical files.

In his GPT's knowledge base, he uploaded:

*   **Imaging:** X-rays and pre/post-surgery MRIs of his knees.
*   **CSVs:** Physiological cycles and sleep data from Whoop.
*   **PDFs:** Three years of blood exams to track evolution.
*   **Text:** A nutrition plan from his dietitian.

This allows the AI to "see" the underlying structure, not just the output metrics.

## The Anatomy of the Prompt

Lucas’s prompting strategy is a masterclass in setting boundaries. He doesn't ask the AI to be a generic fitness coach.

[FRAME_1]

He explicitly defines the **Role**, the **Goal**, and the **Anti-Prompt**.

**The Role:** "Act as my performance strategist and health optimization coach."

**The Goal:** "I want to feel 25 in a 40-year-old's body. I am a high-performance operator, not a professional athlete."

This distinction is critical. He needs to run a company the next day, not just recover from a match.

**The Anti-Prompt:** This is the most valuable part of his setup. He tells the AI what *not* to do:

*   No unproven supplements.
*   No "bio-hacking" fluff (like ozone therapy).
*   No pushing past pain thresholds when HRV is low.

He forces the AI to prioritize longevity and injury prevention over maximum theoretical output.

## Real-World Use Cases

Having a coach in your pocket changes how you make micro-decisions.

Lucas shared a great example involving a sushi birthday dinner.

He told the GPT he would be consuming rice and sake that evening. He asked how to structure his day to mitigate the impact.

[FRAME_2]

The AI adjusted his breakfast and lunch to be high-protein and zero-carb to balance the incoming glucose spike. It didn't judge the decision; it optimized around it.

He also uses it to validate injuries.

When dealing with elbow pain, he uploaded videos of his movement patterns and compared the AI's assessment with his doctor's diagnosis.

The AI confirmed the doctor's view but translated the recovery timeline into a visual, day-by-day plan that the doctor didn't have time to provide.

## The Future of Personal Health

Lucas believes we are moving toward a world of "synthetic clients" and AI interoperability.

In the near future, your personal health AI will talk directly to your doctor's medical AI.

You won't have to explain your sleep history or diet; the context will transfer automatically.

Until then, building a custom GPT is the best way to bridge the gap between your data and your daily actions.
