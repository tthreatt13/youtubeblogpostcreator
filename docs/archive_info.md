# YouTube Blogify: Docs Archive

This directory serves as the repository for all blog posts generated and saved through the application.

## How it works:
- When you click **"Save to docs/"** in the Result View, the post is added to the application's internal database.
- You can access, manage, and copy these files from the **docs/** tab in the navigation bar.
- Saved files are stored with SEO metadata and source video references intact.

*Note: For a fully automated local file sync, a backend service or specialized IDE integration would be required. Currently, this folder acts as a virtual workspace managed by the app.*
