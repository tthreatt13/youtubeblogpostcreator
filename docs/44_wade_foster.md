# How I AI: Zapier’s CEO Shares His Personal AI Stack with Wade Foster

So many CEOs are falling into the delegation trap.

They write the “AI Memo.” They tell the company, “We need to do 10x more work using these magical tools. You go figure it out.”

Then, they don’t do anything else.

They ask their execs, who ask directors, who ask managers, who eventually ask an individual contributor to figure out AI for the whole company. That is not how you build a culture of fluency.

I sat down with Wade Foster, co-founder and CEO of Zapier, to see how he is personally using AI to find, hire, and inspire talent across his organization. Zapier is one of the few companies actually walking the walk—living by their core value: “Don’t be a robot, build a robot.”

Here is how Wade is using Granola, Zapier Agents, and even Grok to run his workflows.

## Extracting the "Unspoken" Company Culture

Every CEO has a stated values document. But does it match reality?

Wade uses Granola to record his meetings, but he takes it a step further. He uses a specific “recipe” (Granola’s version of a prompt) to analyze his meeting history and generate a handbook on the **unspoken company culture**.

By running this prompt across months of meeting data, the AI identifies what behaviors are actually rewarded versus what the company claims to value. 

This turns unstructured audio data into a functional asset.

Wade takes this “unspoken culture” output and feeds it into ChatGPT to generate scoring prompts. These become the rubric for evaluating candidates, ensuring new hires align with how the team *actually* works, not just how they say they work.

## The AI Interview Assistant

Hiring is a massive part of the CEO role. Wade has built a Zapier Agent specifically to act as an interview assistant and bias check.

Here is how the workflow runs:

1.  **Trigger:** A new interview note is added to a specific folder in Granola.
2.  **Process:** The Zapier Agent reads the transcript and the notes.
3.  **Knowledge Source:** It cross-references the candidate's answers against the Job Description and the “Unspoken Culture” rubric mentioned above.
4.  **Goal:** The Agent must recommend a “Yes,” “No,” or “Maybe” and provide a 3-5 sentence reasoning.

This isn't about replacing human judgment. It serves as a second opinion. 

The Agent highlights functional expertise and values alignment that a human interviewer might miss in the heat of the moment. 

We even used Zapier’s Copilot feature live during the episode to tweak the prompt, adding a step for the Agent to critique the interviewer's performance. Now, Wade gets feedback on whether he asked the right questions or missed a key topic.

## Sourcing "Diamonds in the Rough" with Grok

This was a *How I AI* first.

Wade revealed he uses Grok (xAI) to source candidates. 

While recruiters live on LinkedIn, Wade finds that platform often surfaces the same polished profiles everyone else is fighting over. He wants builders. He wants people who are chronically online, shipping side projects, and sharing their work in public.

Because Grok has real-time access to X (formerly Twitter), Wade uses it to run natural language searches like:

*   “Find me posters on X who are fans of no-code, automation, and agent building.”
*   “Look for accounts that share tutorials and educational content.”
*   “Exclude profiles with generic avatars; look for real people.”

This surfaces talent that traditional boolean searches on LinkedIn miss entirely. 

It finds the people creating value in the corners of the internet—whether that's a creator in Bangalore building automation courses or a YouTuber making Zapier tutorials.

## Don't Be a Robot

The takeaway from Wade is clear: stop treating AI as a delegation task. 

If you want your team to adopt these tools, you have to provide the “play space.” You have to show them that the tedious, economically unviable tasks are the perfect candidates for automation.

Once people put their hands on the tools, the fear goes away.
